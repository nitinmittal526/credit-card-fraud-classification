# credit-card-fraud-classification
This project is part of my learning journey in data science.Here i have a credit card transaction dataset with legit(0) and fraud(1) labels in 'class' column and 30 input feature(V1-V28,time,amount).I used unsupervised  tree-based algorithm for anomaly detection. to find the fraudent transactions and see how much accuracy could be achieved.
